## :scroll: Description
Weather forecast app prototype for the Android Dev Challenge. It animates the different weather conditions.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
In this submission i tried animated Canvas drawing. So i use the time as state and generate the animation based 
on the seconds passed by.
I animate the sun clouds and rain. The wind do have influence on how the rain falls and how fast the clouds are moving.
Also the number of clouds vary. On sunny days the sun is burning (So you will see a heart beat effect on the sun)
